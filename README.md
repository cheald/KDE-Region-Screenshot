Helper that makes Spectacle bindable to keys to behave more like OS X or GNOME. Take a screenshot and copy it to the clipboard, so you can directly paste it into Slack or where ever.

    screenshot.sh -f  # Fullscreen
    screenshot.sh -r  # Selectable region
    screenshot.sh -a  # Active window

Set up commands in KDE's "Custom Shortcuts" to call this script with desired flags.
